        <p>We walk, the two of us thtough the auyumn day.</p>
        <p>And in spring too I feel no different.</p> 
        <p>We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves</p> 
        <p>through much dark-red loss,<em>appellation controlee</em></p>     
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>that deepens in the cellar of the years.</p>
        <p>We walk through th beiger-turning woods of Drente.</p> 
        <p>Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees</p> 
        <p>sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.</p>

        <p>33, and in the midst of the dark wood</p>
        <p>of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging.</p> 
        <p>at home in the woods and desolate at home.</p>      
    </section> 
    <section>
        <p>Will we one day, maybe, ever?</p>
        <p>The summer is past, the hay-making is over.</p> 
        <p>The here is nowhere, and the now is never.</p>
